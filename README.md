# hello-world
This is the start of my github page
I am currently in the PhD programme in Media & Arts Technology at Queen Mary University of London, the band Gyratory System and solely responsible for https://jamesdweaver.tumblr.com where I publish my own photography and music.

Always interested in new things.
